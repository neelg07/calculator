# calculator
### Project: Calculator (TOP)
Final project in Foundations which is to make an on-screen calculator using JS, HTML, & CSS.
Functions will include all basic math operators found in typical calculators.

### Pre-Project 
- It seems like this project will be relatively easy compared to etch-a-sketch but I am expecting a few curveballs that will test my knowledge and require Googling.
- Will use CSS to make the calculator have a simple and aesthetically pleasing UI. 
- Will avoid eval() function due to potential pitfalls of evaluating insecure data. 
- Expecting this project to test and increase my logic/reasoning skills in JS, and experience in HTML, CSS.
