# calculator
### Project: Calculator (TOP)
Final project in Foundations which is to make an on-screen calculator using JS, HTML, & CSS.
Functions will include all basic math operators found in typical calculators.

### Pre-Project 
- It seems like this project will be relatively easy compared to etch-a-sketch but I am expecting a few curveballs that will test my knowledge and require Googling.
- Will use CSS to make the calculator have a simple and aesthetically pleasing UI. 
- Will avoid eval() function due to potential pitfalls of evaluating insecure data. 
- Expecting this project to test and increase my logic/reasoning skills in JS, and experience in HTML, CSS.

### Post-Project
- As expected, the HTML/CSS implementation was fairly intuitive. Happy with the overall design format produced and how it looks aesthetically.
- Overview of the project seemed easier than prior projects but implementing logic was trickier than expected.
- Most difficult portions consisted of storing values into variables, manipulating them with different operations, and outputting them into the display. Float imprecision was a small hassle to fix as well. 
- Had to restart the logic portion once or twice before creating an object that solved most of my issues.
- The code I wrote works, but is ultimately very disorganized, might be hard to read for even myself if I come back to this in a few weeks/months. 
- Happy with the working result but need to come back to this project after furthering my knowledge because I know there is a way to do the same thing with cleaner code.
- Completed all extra credit portions of the project.
